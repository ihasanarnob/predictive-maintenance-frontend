        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-600">Why It Matters</h2>
        <p>
          Devices are essential and expensive. Most users don’t realize that they can prevent breakdowns — they wait
          until something fails. This often leads to higher repair costs and shorter device lifespans.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our goal is to reduce <strong>waste, expense, and frustration</strong> by encouraging smarter, proactive maintenance habits.
